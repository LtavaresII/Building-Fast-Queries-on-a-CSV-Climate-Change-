# Building-Fast-Queries-on-a-CSV-Climate-Change-
#
The goal of this project is to create a class that represent the comments about the climate changes on reddit, monitoring the discourse about the climate changes, to find out what people think and discuss on this topic.. The methods in that class will implement the queries that we want to answer about our search. We will also preprocess that data to make those queries run faster.
#
To use this class, first you need to download the database from project on kaggle through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavellexyr/the-reddit-climate-change-dataset
