Aber für Weltuntergangsstimmung haben wir keine Zeit.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; *Von [Philipp Bovermann](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/autoren/autor-1.3421045)*\\n&gt;\\n&gt; 30\\\\. August 2022 - 6 Min. Lesezeit\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Das Beste und zugleich das Schlechteste, das man über die Aktionen der Protestbewegung „Letzte Generation“ sagen kann, ist, dass sie traurig machen. Die zumeist jungen Klimaaktivisten scheinen nicht mehr daran zu glauben, dass die Staaten die notwendigen Maßnahmen gegen eine katastrophale Erderhitzung ergreifen werden. Im vergangenen Sommer adressierten sie noch mit einem Hungerstreik im Berliner Regierungsviertel die Bundespolitik. Inzwischen ist ihr Gegner diffus geworden. Sie kleben sich an Autobahnauffahrten fest, an Gemälden. Am Wochenende versuchte eine Gruppe der Aktivisten, sich beim Bundesligaspiel des FC Bayern gegen Borussia Mönchengladbach mit Kabelbindern an die Torpfosten zu ketten. Bayern-Stürmer Thomas Müller, schon qua Name der Normalodeutsche schlechthin, rempelte einen der beiden an und brüllte ihm unhörbar etwas entgegen.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Herrje, können die sich nicht mal zusammenreißen?**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Es wäre ein Fehler, die Klimakrise zu psychologisieren – sie ist keine Neurose, die Gefahr ist erdrückend real. Die Psychologie hilft aber, die Sackgasse zu erkennen, in die sich die Klimabewegung derzeit manövriert.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; In den vergangenen Jahren, seit Greta Thunberg ihre Wut und Verzweiflung in die höchsten politischen Gremien der Welt trug, begann eine Diskussion über die psychologischen Aspekte der anrollenden Klimakatastrophe, darüber, wie es sich anfühlt, auf einem angezählten Planeten zu leben. Meist war da von der „Klimaangst“ die Rede. Selten von der Trauer.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Gegen die Angst empfehlen Psychologen das Prinzip der Hoffnung: Die „kognitive Dissonanz“ zwischen dem persönlichen Handeln und der immensen Bedrohung lasse sich nicht mit der Brechstange schließen, sagen sie, durch immer drastischere Warnungen. Damit die Angst nicht lähmend wird, sei es ebenso wichtig, sich zu vergegenwärtigen, was kollektiv und individuell noch alles möglich ist.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Das leuchtet ein: Wer nur Dystopien, aber keine Utopien anzubieten hat, überlässt anderen die Initiative und beschränkt sich aufs Verhindern. Man geht in die innere Sitzblockade**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die findet in den allermeisten Fällen aber nicht auf den Gleisen einer Kohletransport-Trasse statt, sondern in einem beheizten Wohnzimmer, auf dem eigenen, dicker werdenden Hintern.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Der Verzweiflung zu entsagen, mutet skeptisch veranlagten Menschen allerdings auch einiges zu. Auf Tiktok geben sich viele junge Klimaaktivisten inzwischen betont optimistisch, handlungsfähig und „resilient“. Zum Beispiel der junge Mann aus Florida, der sich [dabei filmt](https://www.tiktok.com/@trashcaulin/video/7135814842878840110), wie er jeden Tag an den Strand geht und dort mit ganz viel Spaß Plastik sammelt. Das ist besser, als nichts zu tun, klar. Aber es schwingt darin auch der Verdacht protestantischen Kitsches mit. Luther wird das Zitat zugeschrieben, er würde, wenn er wüsste, dass morgen die Welt unterginge, „heute noch ein Apfelbäumchen pflanzen“.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Sollten wir, auch wenn morgen die Welt unterginge, heute noch unseren Müll trennen?**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Der Treibhauseffekt würde ja sogar dann für lange Zeit weitergehen, wenn schon morgen kein Gramm Kohlendioxid mehr in die Atmosphäre gelangte. Die Katastrophe entfaltet sich bereits. Schrecklicher als die Angst ist nach Jahrzehnten verpasster Chancen womöglich die Gewissheit, was bereits unaufhaltsam verloren ist. Klimaaktivisten können heute nur noch versuchen, das Unausweichliche zu begrenzen.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Vielleicht ist das, was da lähmt und zynisch werden lässt, daher gar nicht so sehr die Angst vor dem Kommenden, sondern es sind unbewältigte Gefühle: Trauer um die eigene jahrelange Unbeschwertheit, die den Kindern und Enkeln nicht mehr offensteht. Trauer, die sich wie ein Vanitas-Zeichen in die noch intakten Landschaften einschreibt. *All das wird irgendwann nicht mehr sein.* Trauer um die Menschen in anderen Teilen der Welt, die viel stärker unter den sich häufenden Dürren und Naturkatastrophen zu leiden haben. So viele von ihnen werden hungern, fliehen müssen und sterben. Wie soll man sich das als Teil der industrialisierten Verursachergemeinschaft verzeihen, gar optimistisch in die Zukunft blicken, während der eigene Lebensstil diese Probleme beschleunigt?\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Am diffusesten bei all dem ist die Trauer um die Natur.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Das Verhältnis zu ihr lässt sich deshalb so schwer fassen, weil große Teile der westlichen Geistesgeschichte aus nichts anderem bestehen als dem Bemühen, den Menschen aus ihr abzusondern.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die verdrängte Verbundenheit mir ihr bricht nun, da sie zu verarmen und veröden droht, allenthalben als Wehmut wieder auf. Die Bücher und die Künste sind seit Jahren voll davon. In Bäumen, Pilzen, Moosen oder Kraken, überall erkennt der Mensch sich wieder, wanzt sich an die Natur heran und streicht ihr, wie zum Abschied, über die flauschige Wange. Oder aber er lässt sich auf ihr Gewimmel, ihre Amorphie ein, um auf feierliche Art sprachlos zu werden. „(...) und wo auch nur Pflanzen rauschen, klingt immer eine Klage mit“, schrieb der Kulturphilosoph Walter Benjamin.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Sich von der Sprachlosigkeit überwältigen zu lassen, durch das Dickicht hindurchzugehen, darin liegt die Chance auf Heilung. Die irreparablen Schäden anzuerkennen, um die Zukunft wieder zu öffnen.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Dann, endlich, gibt es Hoffnung.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Politisch wäre es dringend geboten, diesen Schritt zu tun. Die Klimabewegung hat sich in den Bildern, die sie produziert, zuletzt immer tiefer in der Verzweiflung vergraben. „Fridays for Future“ nährte sich einen ekstatischen Sommer lang vom Glauben, man müsse den Leuten die Klimakrise nur nachdrücklich genug erklären („Listen to the science!“), dann würden sie schon losrennen und das „brennende Haus“, die Erde, löschen. Diese naive Hoffnung erzeugte einen ungeheuren gesellschaftlichen Schwung, überlebte aber die vielen unsichtbaren Widerstände in der Realpolitik nicht lang.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die Gruppe Extinction Rebellion machte kurz darauf auf sich aufmerksam als so etwas wie der dunkelromantische Wiedergänger dieser Träume. Die Aktivisten hielten „Trauermärsche“ ab, schminkten sich die Gesichter totenblass und lasen bei Sitzblockaden traurige Gedichte vor.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Auf ein Banner, das sie an der Westminster Bridge in London entrollten, schrieben sie: *\"We\\'re fucked\".***\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die „Letzte Generation“ erzählt nun ebenfalls vom Untergang, dieselbe Geschichte noch mal. Was soll nach ihr noch kommen? Die diesmal wirklich allerletzte Generation?\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Wo bleibt die Gruppe, die den Menschen die frohe Botschaft der ökologischen Befreiung von den Fesseln des fossilen Zeitalters bringt?\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Wo bleibt die erste Generation einer neuen Welt? Es wäre eine bunte, laute Bewegung von ansteckender Heiterkeit, die sich nicht zu schade wäre, auch einmal taktisch fröhlich zu sein, wenn ihr eigentlich nach Weinen zumute wäre.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die von der Krise direkt Betroffenen können es sich ja auch nicht gestatten, der Verzweiflung nachzugeben.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Anstatt die Krise in immer noch und noch dunkleren Farben zu malen, den Berg des Unheils, den es zu erklimmen gäbe, immer weiter aufzutürmen, würden diese Aktivisten die planetare Krise vielmehr kleiner und beherrschbarer erscheinen lassen. Sie würden den Menschen sagen, dass es nicht nur, wohin man auch blickt, kapitalistisches Wachstum gibt, das zwangsläufig in den kollektiven Suizid führt, sondern schon heute Wege in eine bessere Zukunft, auf denen sie mitkommen können. Sie würden ihre Erfolge zu feiern wissen. Auch das Gute wächst ja, langsam und mit Rückschlägen, aber stetig. Grüne Technologien werden immer günstiger. Das Versprechen ist einfach zu gut: kostenlose Energie, die buchstäblich vom Himmel fällt.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Noch vor einem Jahrzehnt ergaben Hochrechnungen, dass der damalige Kurs der Klimapolitik zu einem Temperaturanstieg von vier bis fünf Grad geführt hätte – die Erde würde gebacken wie eine Kartoffel. [Aktuell](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) steuert die Welt auf ein Plus von 2,5 bis 2,9 Grad zu. Die Auswirkungen wären katastrophal, aber doch etliche Höllenkreise weniger schlimm.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Den Rest zu schaffen und die Erderhitzung auf „deutlich unter zwei Grad“ zu begrenzen, wie im Pariser Klimaabkommen festgehalten, ist keineswegs unrealistisch. Im Oktober 2020 [errechnete](https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-stimulus/tenth-of-pandemic-stimulus-spend-could-help-world-reach-climate-goals-study-idUSKBN271098) ein Team von Wissenschaftlern des Imperial College London, dass dafür schon ein Zehntel der zwölf Billionen US-Dollar, die damals als Corona-Rettungspakete versprochen waren, reichen würde. Möglich, dass die Annahmen etwas optimistisch waren. Aber die Rettung der Welt wäre jedenfalls nicht unerschwinglich.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Dass es nicht passiert, liegt an ökonomischen und politischen Interessen. Der Logik der Macht begegnet man ebenbürtig nicht in der Logik der Verzweiflung, indem man aus gefühlter Ohnmacht, die Mächtigen treffen zu können, wahllos Konsumenten-Fußvolk gegen sich aufbringt und die Gesellschaft in der Klimafrage weiter spaltet. Den Planeten und seine Bewohner zu schützen, ist unterm Strich auch nur ein Interesse, das es strategisch durchzusetzen gilt. Anstatt Verzicht zu predigen und ständig zu betonen, warum das alles sowieso nicht reicht, sollte man den Menschen etwas versprechen – *fake it till you make it*. Die Gegenseite tut ja auch nichts anderes, nur viel ungenierter.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Vielleicht ist es, so besehen, gar nicht schlecht, beim melancholischen Grübeln zum Geräusch der tickenden *Doomsday Clock* etwas zynisch geworden zu sein.

Warmer oceans evaporate more water and generate more humid air. \\n\\n&gt;\\tFor one to form, there needs to be warm ocean water and moist, humid air in the region. When humid air is flowing upward at a zone of low pressure over warm ocean water, the water is released from the air, as creating the clouds of the storm.\\n\\n&gt;\\tAs it rises, the air in a hurricane rotates. Air drawn into the center of a hurricane curves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and toward the left in the Southern Hemisphere due to the Coriolis effect — a phenomenon in which winds curve because of the Earth's rotation. At lower latitudes, where there is no Coriolis effect, hurricanes cannot form within 300 miles (500 kilometers) of the equator.\\n\\n&gt;\\tStorms grow if there is a continuous supply of energy from warm ocean water and warm, moist air. Tropical storms can grow into hurricanes, and hurricanes can grow into stronger hurricanes. However, only a small number of storms grow into tropical storms. Even fewer become hurricanes.\\n\\n&gt;\\tStorms weaken when they move over areas with cooler ocean water. There isn’t nearly as much energy in the water to fuel the storm, nor is there as much humidity in the air. Hurricanes also weaken when they travel over land.\\n\\nTaken from here: https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/storms/how-hurricanes-form\\n\\n&gt;\\tLarge sections of the global oceans have warmed 1-3°F during the last century, with some buoy locations having a more dramatic rise recently. Of the Gulf of Mexico buoys analyzed, the average water temperature from August through October has risen 1-2°F in the last 40 years. The buoys analyzed in the Atlantic have warmed even more during that three-month period — 2-4°F in the last 30 years. While at single buoys the water may have warmed faster or slower than other locations, globally, there is a clear trend towards hotter sea surface temperatures.\\n\\n&gt;\\tWarmer water fuels hurricanes, and not surprisingly, the average number of major hurricanes — those Category 3 or higher — has increased in the Atlantic basin since the 1970s. Globally, climate models project that there will likely be an increase in the wind speed and rainfall intensity of the strongest hurricanes (aka tropical cyclones), even though their frequency may remain unchanged or even decrease by the end of this century. However, the extent of these effects from climate change will vary by region.\\n\\n&gt;\\tEven with no increase in storm strength, the damage from storm surge is already worse because warming waters are also contributing to sea level rise. Seas are projected to rise up to at least another 3 feet by the end of the century, only adding additional water to any tropical system’s dangerous storm surge.\\n\\nTaken from here: https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/us-coastal-water-temperature-trends\\n\\nTLDR: Atlantic, where hurricanes that end up in the Gulf of Mexico form, is warming. The Gulf is also warming. Warmer Atlantic means more energy to feed the air cycle of a nascent storm system and help it develop into a hurricane. The warmer Gulf will help ensure less energy is lost as the system moves from its forming grounds. Rising sea levels (they are already rising) will also make storm surges worse. \\n\\nThe best we can hope for is an increased frequency of storms that we can just about manage. The worst case is the same frequency we’ve seen in recent years, which is up on historic averages, but with more of the mega Cat 5 systems actually making landfall.\\n\\nI wouldn’t buy property anyway on the Gulf cost.
