Aber für Weltuntergangsstimmung haben wir keine Zeit.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; *Von [Philipp Bovermann](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/autoren/autor-1.3421045)*\\n&gt;\\n&gt; 30\\\\. August 2022 - 6 Min. Lesezeit\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Das Beste und zugleich das Schlechteste, das man über die Aktionen der Protestbewegung „Letzte Generation“ sagen kann, ist, dass sie traurig machen. Die zumeist jungen Klimaaktivisten scheinen nicht mehr daran zu glauben, dass die Staaten die notwendigen Maßnahmen gegen eine katastrophale Erderhitzung ergreifen werden. Im vergangenen Sommer adressierten sie noch mit einem Hungerstreik im Berliner Regierungsviertel die Bundespolitik. Inzwischen ist ihr Gegner diffus geworden. Sie kleben sich an Autobahnauffahrten fest, an Gemälden. Am Wochenende versuchte eine Gruppe der Aktivisten, sich beim Bundesligaspiel des FC Bayern gegen Borussia Mönchengladbach mit Kabelbindern an die Torpfosten zu ketten. Bayern-Stürmer Thomas Müller, schon qua Name der Normalodeutsche schlechthin, rempelte einen der beiden an und brüllte ihm unhörbar etwas entgegen.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Herrje, können die sich nicht mal zusammenreißen?**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Es wäre ein Fehler, die Klimakrise zu psychologisieren – sie ist keine Neurose, die Gefahr ist erdrückend real. Die Psychologie hilft aber, die Sackgasse zu erkennen, in die sich die Klimabewegung derzeit manövriert.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; In den vergangenen Jahren, seit Greta Thunberg ihre Wut und Verzweiflung in die höchsten politischen Gremien der Welt trug, begann eine Diskussion über die psychologischen Aspekte der anrollenden Klimakatastrophe, darüber, wie es sich anfühlt, auf einem angezählten Planeten zu leben. Meist war da von der „Klimaangst“ die Rede. Selten von der Trauer.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Gegen die Angst empfehlen Psychologen das Prinzip der Hoffnung: Die „kognitive Dissonanz“ zwischen dem persönlichen Handeln und der immensen Bedrohung lasse sich nicht mit der Brechstange schließen, sagen sie, durch immer drastischere Warnungen. Damit die Angst nicht lähmend wird, sei es ebenso wichtig, sich zu vergegenwärtigen, was kollektiv und individuell noch alles möglich ist.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Das leuchtet ein: Wer nur Dystopien, aber keine Utopien anzubieten hat, überlässt anderen die Initiative und beschränkt sich aufs Verhindern. Man geht in die innere Sitzblockade**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die findet in den allermeisten Fällen aber nicht auf den Gleisen einer Kohletransport-Trasse statt, sondern in einem beheizten Wohnzimmer, auf dem eigenen, dicker werdenden Hintern.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Der Verzweiflung zu entsagen, mutet skeptisch veranlagten Menschen allerdings auch einiges zu. Auf Tiktok geben sich viele junge Klimaaktivisten inzwischen betont optimistisch, handlungsfähig und „resilient“. Zum Beispiel der junge Mann aus Florida, der sich [dabei filmt](https://www.tiktok.com/@trashcaulin/video/7135814842878840110), wie er jeden Tag an den Strand geht und dort mit ganz viel Spaß Plastik sammelt. Das ist besser, als nichts zu tun, klar. Aber es schwingt darin auch der Verdacht protestantischen Kitsches mit. Luther wird das Zitat zugeschrieben, er würde, wenn er wüsste, dass morgen die Welt unterginge, „heute noch ein Apfelbäumchen pflanzen“.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Sollten wir, auch wenn morgen die Welt unterginge, heute noch unseren Müll trennen?**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Der Treibhauseffekt würde ja sogar dann für lange Zeit weitergehen, wenn schon morgen kein Gramm Kohlendioxid mehr in die Atmosphäre gelangte. Die Katastrophe entfaltet sich bereits. Schrecklicher als die Angst ist nach Jahrzehnten verpasster Chancen womöglich die Gewissheit, was bereits unaufhaltsam verloren ist. Klimaaktivisten können heute nur noch versuchen, das Unausweichliche zu begrenzen.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Vielleicht ist das, was da lähmt und zynisch werden lässt, daher gar nicht so sehr die Angst vor dem Kommenden, sondern es sind unbewältigte Gefühle: Trauer um die eigene jahrelange Unbeschwertheit, die den Kindern und Enkeln nicht mehr offensteht. Trauer, die sich wie ein Vanitas-Zeichen in die noch intakten Landschaften einschreibt. *All das wird irgendwann nicht mehr sein.* Trauer um die Menschen in anderen Teilen der Welt, die viel stärker unter den sich häufenden Dürren und Naturkatastrophen zu leiden haben. So viele von ihnen werden hungern, fliehen müssen und sterben. Wie soll man sich das als Teil der industrialisierten Verursachergemeinschaft verzeihen, gar optimistisch in die Zukunft blicken, während der eigene Lebensstil diese Probleme beschleunigt?\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Am diffusesten bei all dem ist die Trauer um die Natur.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Das Verhältnis zu ihr lässt sich deshalb so schwer fassen, weil große Teile der westlichen Geistesgeschichte aus nichts anderem bestehen als dem Bemühen, den Menschen aus ihr abzusondern.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die verdrängte Verbundenheit mir ihr bricht nun, da sie zu verarmen und veröden droht, allenthalben als Wehmut wieder auf. Die Bücher und die Künste sind seit Jahren voll davon. In Bäumen, Pilzen, Moosen oder Kraken, überall erkennt der Mensch sich wieder, wanzt sich an die Natur heran und streicht ihr, wie zum Abschied, über die flauschige Wange. Oder aber er lässt sich auf ihr Gewimmel, ihre Amorphie ein, um auf feierliche Art sprachlos zu werden. „(...) und wo auch nur Pflanzen rauschen, klingt immer eine Klage mit“, schrieb der Kulturphilosoph Walter Benjamin.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Sich von der Sprachlosigkeit überwältigen zu lassen, durch das Dickicht hindurchzugehen, darin liegt die Chance auf Heilung. Die irreparablen Schäden anzuerkennen, um die Zukunft wieder zu öffnen.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Dann, endlich, gibt es Hoffnung.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Politisch wäre es dringend geboten, diesen Schritt zu tun. Die Klimabewegung hat sich in den Bildern, die sie produziert, zuletzt immer tiefer in der Verzweiflung vergraben. „Fridays for Future“ nährte sich einen ekstatischen Sommer lang vom Glauben, man müsse den Leuten die Klimakrise nur nachdrücklich genug erklären („Listen to the science!“), dann würden sie schon losrennen und das „brennende Haus“, die Erde, löschen. Diese naive Hoffnung erzeugte einen ungeheuren gesellschaftlichen Schwung, überlebte aber die vielen unsichtbaren Widerstände in der Realpolitik nicht lang.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die Gruppe Extinction Rebellion machte kurz darauf auf sich aufmerksam als so etwas wie der dunkelromantische Wiedergänger dieser Träume. Die Aktivisten hielten „Trauermärsche“ ab, schminkten sich die Gesichter totenblass und lasen bei Sitzblockaden traurige Gedichte vor.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Auf ein Banner, das sie an der Westminster Bridge in London entrollten, schrieben sie: *\"We\\'re fucked\".***\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die „Letzte Generation“ erzählt nun ebenfalls vom Untergang, dieselbe Geschichte noch mal. Was soll nach ihr noch kommen? Die diesmal wirklich allerletzte Generation?\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Wo bleibt die Gruppe, die den Menschen die frohe Botschaft der ökologischen Befreiung von den Fesseln des fossilen Zeitalters bringt?\\n&gt;\\n&gt; **Wo bleibt die erste Generation einer neuen Welt? Es wäre eine bunte, laute Bewegung von ansteckender Heiterkeit, die sich nicht zu schade wäre, auch einmal taktisch fröhlich zu sein, wenn ihr eigentlich nach Weinen zumute wäre.**\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Die von der Krise direkt Betroffenen können es sich ja auch nicht gestatten, der Verzweiflung nachzugeben.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Anstatt die Krise in immer noch und noch dunkleren Farben zu malen, den Berg des Unheils, den es zu erklimmen gäbe, immer weiter aufzutürmen, würden diese Aktivisten die planetare Krise vielmehr kleiner und beherrschbarer erscheinen lassen. Sie würden den Menschen sagen, dass es nicht nur, wohin man auch blickt, kapitalistisches Wachstum gibt, das zwangsläufig in den kollektiven Suizid führt, sondern schon heute Wege in eine bessere Zukunft, auf denen sie mitkommen können. Sie würden ihre Erfolge zu feiern wissen. Auch das Gute wächst ja, langsam und mit Rückschlägen, aber stetig. Grüne Technologien werden immer günstiger. Das Versprechen ist einfach zu gut: kostenlose Energie, die buchstäblich vom Himmel fällt.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Noch vor einem Jahrzehnt ergaben Hochrechnungen, dass der damalige Kurs der Klimapolitik zu einem Temperaturanstieg von vier bis fünf Grad geführt hätte – die Erde würde gebacken wie eine Kartoffel. [Aktuell](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) steuert die Welt auf ein Plus von 2,5 bis 2,9 Grad zu. Die Auswirkungen wären katastrophal, aber doch etliche Höllenkreise weniger schlimm.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Den Rest zu schaffen und die Erderhitzung auf „deutlich unter zwei Grad“ zu begrenzen, wie im Pariser Klimaabkommen festgehalten, ist keineswegs unrealistisch. Im Oktober 2020 [errechnete](https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-stimulus/tenth-of-pandemic-stimulus-spend-could-help-world-reach-climate-goals-study-idUSKBN271098) ein Team von Wissenschaftlern des Imperial College London, dass dafür schon ein Zehntel der zwölf Billionen US-Dollar, die damals als Corona-Rettungspakete versprochen waren, reichen würde. Möglich, dass die Annahmen etwas optimistisch waren. Aber die Rettung der Welt wäre jedenfalls nicht unerschwinglich.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Dass es nicht passiert, liegt an ökonomischen und politischen Interessen. Der Logik der Macht begegnet man ebenbürtig nicht in der Logik der Verzweiflung, indem man aus gefühlter Ohnmacht, die Mächtigen treffen zu können, wahllos Konsumenten-Fußvolk gegen sich aufbringt und die Gesellschaft in der Klimafrage weiter spaltet. Den Planeten und seine Bewohner zu schützen, ist unterm Strich auch nur ein Interesse, das es strategisch durchzusetzen gilt. Anstatt Verzicht zu predigen und ständig zu betonen, warum das alles sowieso nicht reicht, sollte man den Menschen etwas versprechen – *fake it till you make it*. Die Gegenseite tut ja auch nichts anderes, nur viel ungenierter.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Vielleicht ist es, so besehen, gar nicht schlecht, beim melancholischen Grübeln zum Geräusch der tickenden *Doomsday Clock* etwas zynisch geworden zu sein.

It is grim reading. If the planet warms by 2\\u2009°C — the widely touted temperature limit in the 2015 Paris climate agreement — twice as many people will face water scarcity than if warming is limited to 1.5\\u2009°C. That extra warming will also expose more than 1.5 billion people to deadly heat extremes, and hundreds of millions of individuals to vector-borne diseases such as malaria, among other harms.\\n\\n&gt;But the latest IPCC special report underplays another alarming fact: global warming is accelerating. Three trends — rising emissions, declining air pollution and natural climate cycles — will combine over the next 20 years to make climate change faster and more furious than anticipated. In our view, there’s a good chance that we could breach the 1.5\\u2009°C level by 2030, not by 2040 as projected in the special report (see ‘Accelerated warming’). The climate-modelling community has not grappled enough with the rapid changes that policymakers care most about, preferring to focus on longer-term trends and equilibria.\\n\\nThe IPCC is conservative in its predictions.

        " '&gt;In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report setting out why we must stop global warming at 1.5\\u2009°C above pre-industrial levels, and how to do so1. It is grim reading. If the planet warms by 2\\u2009°C — the widely touted temperature limit in the 2015 Paris climate agreement — twice as many people will face water scarcity than if warming is limited to 1.5\\u2009°C. That extra warming will also expose more than 1.5 billion people to deadly heat extremes, and hundreds of millions of individuals to vector-borne diseases such as malaria, among other harms.\\n\\n&gt;But the latest IPCC special report underplays another alarming fact: global warming is accelerating. Three trends — rising emissions, declining air pollution and natural climate cycles — will combine over the next 20 years to make climate change faster and more furious than anticipated. In our view, there’s a good chance that we could breach the 1.5\\u2009°C level by 2030, not by 2040 as projected in the special report (see ‘Accelerated warming’). The climate-modelling community has not grappled enough with the rapid changes that policymakers care most about, preferring to focus on longer-term trends and equilibria.\\n\\nThe IPCC is conservative in its predictions. This paper, published in 2018, details the reasons to expect global warming to occur faster than expected.\\n\\nThis is related to collapse because global warming on its own can destroy the food system through floods, droughts impacting food production.',\n",

Warmer oceans evaporate more water and generate more humid air. \\n\\n&gt;\\tFor one to form, there needs to be warm ocean water and moist, humid air in the region. When humid air is flowing upward at a zone of low pressure over warm ocean water, the water is released from the air, as creating the clouds of the storm.\\n\\n&gt;\\tAs it rises, the air in a hurricane rotates. Air drawn into the center of a hurricane curves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and toward the left in the Southern Hemisphere due to the Coriolis effect — a phenomenon in which winds curve because of the Earth's rotation. At lower latitudes, where there is no Coriolis effect, hurricanes cannot form within 300 miles (500 kilometers) of the equator.\\n\\n&gt;\\tStorms grow if there is a continuous supply of energy from warm ocean water and warm, moist air. Tropical storms can grow into hurricanes, and hurricanes can grow into stronger hurricanes. However, only a small number of storms grow into tropical storms. Even fewer become hurricanes.\\n\\n&gt;\\tStorms weaken when they move over areas with cooler ocean water. There isn’t nearly as much energy in the water to fuel the storm, nor is there as much humidity in the air. Hurricanes also weaken when they travel over land.\\n\\nTaken from here: https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/storms/how-hurricanes-form\\n\\n&gt;\\tLarge sections of the global oceans have warmed 1-3°F during the last century, with some buoy locations having a more dramatic rise recently. Of the Gulf of Mexico buoys analyzed, the average water temperature from August through October has risen 1-2°F in the last 40 years. The buoys analyzed in the Atlantic have warmed even more during that three-month period — 2-4°F in the last 30 years. While at single buoys the water may have warmed faster or slower than other locations, globally, there is a clear trend towards hotter sea surface temperatures.\\n\\n&gt;\\tWarmer water fuels hurricanes, and not surprisingly, the average number of major hurricanes — those Category 3 or higher — has increased in the Atlantic basin since the 1970s. Globally, climate models project that there will likely be an increase in the wind speed and rainfall intensity of the strongest hurricanes (aka tropical cyclones), even though their frequency may remain unchanged or even decrease by the end of this century. However, the extent of these effects from climate change will vary by region.\\n\\n&gt;\\tEven with no increase in storm strength, the damage from storm surge is already worse because warming waters are also contributing to sea level rise. Seas are projected to rise up to at least another 3 feet by the end of the century, only adding additional water to any tropical system’s dangerous storm surge.\\n\\nTaken from here: https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/us-coastal-water-temperature-trends\\n\\nTLDR: Atlantic, where hurricanes that end up in the Gulf of Mexico form, is warming. The Gulf is also warming. Warmer Atlantic means more energy to feed the air cycle of a nascent storm system and help it develop into a hurricane. The warmer Gulf will help ensure less energy is lost as the system moves from its forming grounds. Rising sea levels (they are already rising) will also make storm surges worse. \\n\\nThe best we can hope for is an increased frequency of storms that we can just about manage. The worst case is the same frequency we’ve seen in recent years, which is up on historic averages, but with more of the mega Cat 5 systems actually making landfall.\\n\\nI wouldn’t buy property anyway on the Gulf cost.

It’s a comforting tale, and one that is endorsed by the world’s most powerful governments and corporations. But is it true?\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Since 1960, the income gap between the North and South has roughly tripled in size. Today 4.3 billion people, 60 per cent of the world's population, live on less than $5 per day. Some 1 billion live on less than $1 a day. The richest eight people now control the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the world combined.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;What is causing this growing divide? We are told that poverty is a natural phenomenon that can be fixed with aid. But in reality it is a political problem: poverty doesn’t just exist, it has been created.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Poor countries are poor because they are integrated into the global economic system on unequal terms. Aid only works to hide the deep patterns of wealth extraction that cause poverty and inequality in the first place: rigged trade deals, tax evasion, land grabs and the costs associated with climate change. The Divide tracks the evolution of this system, from the expeditions of Christopher Columbus in the 1490s to the international debt regime, which has allowed a handful of rich countries to effectively control economic policies in the rest of the world.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Because poverty is a political problem, it requires political solutions. The Divide offers a range of revelatory answers, but also explains that something much more radical is needed – a revolution in our way of thinking. Drawing on pioneering research, detailed analysis and years of first-hand experience, The Divide is a provocative, urgent and ultimately uplifting account of how the world works, and how it can change.\\n\\n^(This book has been suggested 57 times)\\n\\n***\\n\\n^(63053 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)\",\n",

The Old Kingdom was heavily stressed by the general Bronze Age Collapse (basically around 1170 BC there was a huge crisis across the Mediterranean world, possibly driven by climate change, resulting in wars and chaos and whatnot, and then some local Dark Ages).  The New Kingdom survived for a while, but badly wounded.  But eventually there was a a string of bad harvests and incompetent Pharaohs and finally Egypt broke up into smaller states.\\n\\nThen after some time Egypt was reunited -- but not under Egyptian rulers.  The new Pharaohs were a dynasty descended from barbarian invaders: the Meshwesh, a tribe of Berbers from the deserts of Libya.  \\nAfter a century or so the Meshwesh kingdom fell apart.  Then Egypt got reunited *again* by *another* set of barbarian conquerors -- Nubians this time, Africans from further up the Nile. They ruled Egypt pretty well for a while, but eventually the Nubians got defeated by the Assyrians.  Egypt broke up again, then was partially vassalized by Assyria, then was briefly reunited under one last dynasty of Egyptian pharaohs, then was conquered by Persia.\\n\\nNow, on one hand, all this took generations.  Like, those last few paragraphs covered about five hundred years.  So people lived whole lifetimes under Meshwesh or Nubian dynasties.  But on the other hand, all this happened pretty fast compared to the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, which were stable empires that lasted for many centuries.  So all these -- breakups, Meshwesh, Nubians, Assyrians -- get swept together into the \"Third Intermediate\" and \"Late\" periods.  Basically these are periods when Egypt mostly either wasn\\'t united, or if it was, was united under foreign rule.',\n",

Since it is now clear that the truth would eventually come out when the BBC aired its own documentary in November 2019 showing bears driving walrus to their deaths, the Netflix/Attenborough ruse seemed like a silly PR stunt.\\n\\nNow I know otherwise.\\n\\nAttenborough must have known after seeing the footage he was to narrate that the walrus death sequence was a visual even better than a starving polar bear for convincing people that a human-caused climate emergency was at hand.

But the speaker is not a climate specialist, experts say the claims are false, and world scientists overwhelmingly agree that humans are heating the planet by burning fossil fuels.\\n\\n➖The author, predictably, “is not a climate specialist” himself, holding a PG Diploma in Journalism from City University and a Master’s Degree in Literae Humaniores (Classics) from Oxford, which doesn’t impair his confidence in his climate science fact-checking chops.

The best way to refute wrong statements, whatever their origin, is to expose them to the sunlight of open discussion.

        " 'Yeah sure you can link the report. I mean we can look at climate change from the 3 perspectives --  **Vulnerability, Resilience and Mitigation**. There is one more I think which is **Adaptability** but lets focus on these 3 for now.   \\n\\nLets first discuss Mitigation, I think the political structure of the United States is much more rigid and inflexible which makes decision making a long drawn out  process, like how the first climate change act was passed very recently even though there was scientific consensus and even leaders of both party knew that its gonna be a problem but the politics of the nation creates a much more longer cycle of decision making **Meaning** \\\\-- It takes a problem to become that much bigger before there is wider consensus about what rationally needs to happen. In India however it is politically easier to take  decisions quickly by the state, this often devolves into tyranny and then courts have to intervene and all that but in the context of Climate change mitigation, the three level political system I think is structurally equipped to deal with the mitigation part of it. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn the last few years, because of the decreasing prices of battery powered vehicles there has been rise of e-mobility and that has penetrated right down to the village level. The rise of e Rickshaws, Most of the major auto providers are going to launch their own brand of cheap, mid range and expensive e-vehicles in next 12 months. There is focus by the government on diversifying the energy basket meaning, Indian currently depends on  energy for crude oil which against restrains the geopolitical and economic choices because increase and decrease in international crude oil leads to inflation which the \"state\" can\\'t control so there is this incentive for india to spend in renewables so that it is financially independent in that sense. I think it is the decreasing price of renewables which is the major factor which favours mitigation and India has Deserts and other Solar surplus regions, it has windy regions, it has areas with coastal waves energy projects, it has 10-11 I think Nuclear projects so I think the economics will make it easier. But Coal will still remain important for some time.  The first process of the Climate change mitigation is the realization within the wider economic structures that **Decarbonization doesn\\'t necessarily have to  lead to economic contraction. This is the first step.** This step usually takes some time because often decarbonization is expensive but if you can show it to your people that investing in renewable doesn\\'t mean contraction and can lead to economic growth now that\\'s something which is revolutionary. So I think India is well placed to do its bit on the Mitigation front and there is no anti-climate change lobby here and citizenry and civil society is structurally well placed to transition. The only choke point which I can remember right now is the Energy storage capability and Power Grid stability meaning the solar and wind are intermittent power sources and are active only for some part of the day and require storage and some continued production sources to compliment it which can pose a problem**. Its not the will of the people to climate action which is the restraining factor but the technology and the economics of it**.\\n\\n2. I think there is considerable **Resilience** within the government and Non government structures to deal with any crisis. I mean it took about 2 years to vaccinate over 100 crore people and that is a impressive task. Every district has Disaster response plans, which  is a very recent phenomena so there are bound to be gaps but then overtime these institutions are bound to strengthen. India has a good Satellite and remote sensing network. Increased digitization has also made it very easier for state to do targeted social welfare to the bank account of those folks who are facing disaster within days or weeks. India is one of the biggest pharmaceutical producers and one of the worlds largest food producer and has about 60-70 million tonnes of food grains in storage for emergencies at any given time so that\\'s something. I mean the presence of state capacity, information network, cheap internet, food and medicine self sufficiency makes it easier for societies to deal with problems. However there is considerable inequality within society and that gap is usually filled by government subsidies which is considerable and NGOs also pitch in.  But then again India is low income country, there is not much fiscal space. I think if India grows upto be lets say about 10 trillion economy in next decade or so then Government can do anything in case of emergencies. I mean remember global help is welcome always but in times when everyone is suffering as seen in Covid19, countries tend to look inward. **I don\\'t think there are chances of government instability at all. The Indian political structure is just too wide and inclusive, there is no single focal point around which people can mobilize to so a regional instability can spread.** What I mean is -- sure there can be regional problems but structurally it is very difficult for those problems to spread because again all those fractures which I mentioned in the last comment comes into play. In fact people tend to come together when there are societal level problems. Disasters themselves actually lead to much more social cohesion and togetherness, it is the lack of resources later which leads to social contentions. If India is rich meaning it has lots of economic activity which can be diverted when need arises then I think It should remain stable. More so sustainability is inherent in the religious teachings and forest and nature plays a important role in rural societies so even animal conservation is culturally important phenomenon  and there are various schemes through which problems like excess pollution and deforestation and land degradation are being dealt with. Again all this depend on the per capita wealth of an average citizen which is considerably lower than average global citizen which leads to a state with less capacity to provide services at scale. As economy grows so will the resiliency. Its like that person who is not poor but is one major injury away from Poverty line, the person who is upper middle class is better equipped to deal with problems. Science and technology related solutions require economic capital to solve problems at scale and when people truly work together, they can solve most of the problems. Climate appropriate agriculture which is decentralized is one such initiative. \\n\\n3. Now I do think **India is one of the most vulnerable country** when one talks about Climate change.\\n\\n\\\\-- There are low lying areas which might face saline water intrusion \\n\\n\\\\-- There are water stressed areas and drought and flood prone areas.\\n\\nSo yeah I think Vulnerability to various disasters is high that can\\'t be changed I guess.',\n",

The city’s denizens have become accustomed to a roughshod new way of living; however, the city is starting to fray along the edges—crime and corruption have set in, the contradictions of incredible wealth alongside direst poverty are spawning unrest, and a new disease called “the breaks” is ravaging the population.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;When a strange new visitor arrives—a woman riding an orca, with a polar bear at her side—the city is entranced.

By banding together to save their city before it crumbles under the weight of its own decay, they will learn shocking truths about themselves.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Blackfish City is a remarkably urgent—and ultimately very hopeful—novel about political corruption, organized crime, technology run amok, the consequences of climate change, gender identity, and the unifying power of human connection.\\n\\n^(This book has been suggested 2 times)\\n\\n***\\n\\n^(62822 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)\",\n",
